# GoSudoku
A sudoku solver with an Elm lang front end.
This is really my way of touring the [Go](https://golang.org/) language. I will update this source to 'idiomatic' Go over time. Hopefully the preferred style of writing go will be learnt over time.

### Libraries & frameworks
I have tried my best to steer away from using third party libraries where I can. However, I use [Ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/), a BDD framework, for testing.

### The front end
I have also chosen to write a simple front-end in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/). None of the frontend written yet!
