# GoSudoku
A sudoku solver with an Elm lang front end.
This is really my way of touring the [Go](https://golang.org/) language. I will update this source to 'idiomatic' Go over time. Hopefully the preferred style of writing go will be learnt over time.

### Libraries & frameworks
I have tried my best to steer away from using third party libraries where I can. However, I use [Ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/), a BDD framework, for testing.

#### Libraries to explore
- [Gorilla](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/)
- [Gin](https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/)

### The front end
I have also chosen to write a simple front-end in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/). None of the frontend written yet!

### Work in progress
- Add Elm front end
- Allow posts of Sudoku images; Use ML to decode and solve
- Benchmarks - How does this fares against very hard Sudokus
- Deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/go)
