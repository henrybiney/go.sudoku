# GoSudoku
A sudoku solver.
This is really my way of touring the [Go](https://golang.org/) language and it's not meant to be a production grade constraint solver. 

### Libraries & frameworks
I have tried my best to steer away from using third party libraries where I can. However, I use [Ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/), a BDD framework, for testing.


### Work in progress
- Allow posts of Sudoku images; Use ML to decode and solve
- Benchmarks - How does this fare against very hard Sudokus?
- Deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/go)
